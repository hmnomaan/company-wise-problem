### Description
Amazon sells books, every book has books which are strongly associated with it. Given ListA and ListB,indicates that ListA [i] is associated with ListB [i] which represents the book and associated books. Output the largest set associated with each other(output in any sort). You can assume that there is only one of the largest set.

## i 
The number of books does not exceed 5000.




## Example
```python
Example 1:
	Input:  ListA = ["abc","abc","abc"], ListB = ["bcd","acd","def"]
	Output:  ["abc","acd","bcd","def"]
	Explanation:
	abc is associated with bcd, acd, dfe, so the largest set is the set of all books
	
Example 2:
	Input:  ListA = ["a","b","d","e","f"], ListB = ["b","c","e","g","g"]
	Output:  ["d","e","f","g"]
	Explanation:
	The current set are [a, b, c] and [d, e, g, f], then the largest set is [d, e, g, f]

```
```python


```

### Official answer from lintcode
Algorithm Union-find Algorithm analysis The question gives two lists of book names. Books in the same position in the two lists represent their mutual association. The question requires finding the largest set of books that are mutually associated. The essence of this question is actually a problem of merging and querying disjoint sets. For this kind of problem, ordinary data structures cannot take into account both time complexity and space complexity. In the face of this kind of problem, we can choose the data structure of union-find. Its search and merge functions can solve this problem well. Algorithm steps 1. Data preprocessing: traverse the two lists and use hash to associate each book name with a unique integer. 2. Initialize the union-find array: ùëì [ ùëñ ] = ùëñ f[i]=i, that is, each book is associated with itself. 3. Union-find operation: For books in the same position in the two lists, call ùëì ùëñ ùëõ ùëë find function and then update the union-find array. 4. Union-find set search operation: count the most frequent numbers in the union-find set, i.e. the largest associated set. 5. Reconvert the numbers to book names, generate a list of book names and output it. Complexity analysis Time complexity: approximately ùëÇ ( ùëõ ) O(n),  ùëõ n is the number of book names The time complexity of data preprocessing and the final reconversion to string is ùëÇ ( ùëõ ) O(n), and the time complexity of the union-find set is ùëÇ ( ùëõ ) O( n‚ãÖAlpha(n)) (Alpha is an inverse function of the Ackerman function) Space complexity: ùëÇ ( ùëõ ) O(n),  ùëõ n is the number of book names It is necessary to convert strings and numbers into two ‚Ñé ùëé ùë† ‚Ñé ùëö ùëé ùëù hashmap dictionaries and a union-find array. The length of each is the number of book names.
