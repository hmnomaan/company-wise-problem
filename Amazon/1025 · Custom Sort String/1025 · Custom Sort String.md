### Description
S and T are strings composed of lowercase letters. In S, no letter occurs more than once.

S was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of T so that they match the order that S was sorted. More specifically, if x occurs before y in S, then x should occur before y in the returned string.

The characters in the string T that do not exist in S are placed at the end of the string in dictionary order.

## (i) 
S has length at most 26, and no character is repeated in S.
T has length at most 200.
S and T consist of lowercase letters only.


## Example
```python
Example :
Input: 
S = "cba"
T = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
Explanation: 
"a", "b", "c" appear in S, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".
Since "d" does not appear in S, it is placed at the end of T.

```
```python


```

--- >  > > Count the characters in t with counter Spell them in the order of s Put the remaining characters in t that are not in s at the end in lexicographic order It is best to put the string in a list first and join it at the end, so that the time complexity is the lowest
