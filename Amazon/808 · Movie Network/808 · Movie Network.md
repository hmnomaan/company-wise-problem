### Description
Give some rating of movie (number starting from 0) and their relationship, and relationships can be passed (a and b are related, b and c are related, a and c are also considered to be related). Give every movie's relationship list.Given a movie numbered S, find the top K movies with the highest rating in the movies associated with S(When the number of movies which associated with S is less than K, output all the movies .You can output them in any order). Does not include this movie.

(i)
the number of movies is n, and n <= 20000.
We guarantee that the number is 0 ~ n-1.
We guarantee that the numbers of the 2 vertices of an edge both belong to 0 ~ n-1.
We guarantee that the numbers of the edges is m, and m <= 100000.
We guarantee that the rating of each movie is not the same.


## Example
1
```python
Input:  
ratingArray = [10,20,30,40], 
contactRelationship = [[1,3],[0,2],[1],[0]], 
S = 0, K = 2
Output:  [2,3]	
Explanation:
	In contactRelationship, [1,3] is associated with 0,[0,2] is associated with 1,[1] is associated 2,[0] is associated with 3.
	Finally,Movies numbered [1,2,3] are associated with movie 0, and the order which according to their rating from high to low is [3,2,1], so the output [2,3].

```

```python
Input:  
ratingArray = [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90], 
contactRelationship = [[1,4,5],[0,2,3],[1,7],[1,6,7],[0],[0],[3],[2,3],[]], 
S = 5, K = 3
Output:  [6,7,4]	
Explanation:
	In contactRelationship,[1,4,5] is associated with 0,[0,2,3] is associated with 1,[1,7] is associated with 2,[1,6,7] is is associated with 3,[0] is associated with 4,[0] is associated with 5,[3] is associated with 6,[2,3] is associated with 7,no moive is associated with 8.
	Finally,Movies numbered [0,1,2,3,4,6,7] are associated with movie 5, and the order which according to their rating from high to low is [7,6,4,3,2,1,0]. Notice that movie 8 is not related to movie 5, so it has the highest rating but does not count towards the answer.

### Official answer from lintcode
Just start DFS from S and maintain a priority queue of size K.

    @param S: the begin movie

    @return: the top k largest rating moive which contact with S
    """

        self.visit = {}
        self.Q = Queue.PriorityQueue() 
    class node :
        def __init__(self, rating, id):
            self.id = id
            self.rating = rating
        def __cmp__(self, other):
            return self.rating > other.rating
    def dfs(self, u, limit, rating, G, S):
        self.visit[u] = 1
        First = self.node(0,0)
        if self.Q.qsize() != 0:
