### Description

Given a string s and a list of strings dict, do the following repeatedly for s until none of the strings in dict are substrings of s.

If a string in dict is a substring of s, remove that substring from s
If more than one string in dict is a substring of s, remove any one of the strings s
Design a scheme that minimizes the length of the removed s and returns this minimum length.

## (i) A substring is a part of string that deleted a prefix and a postfix.



## Example
Example
Example 1:

```python
Input:
"ccdaabcdbb"
["ab","cd"]
Output:
2
Explanation: The following operations are performed in order:
s = "ccda[ab]cdbb", deleting "ab" starting with subscript 4 to get s = "ccdacdbb"
s = "c[cd]acdbb", delete "cd" starting with subscript 1 to get s = "cacdbb"
s = "ca[cd]bb", delete "cd" starting with subscript 2 to get s = "cabb"
s = "c[ab]b", delete "ab" starting with subscript 1 to get s = "cb"

The substring of s no longer exists in the dict, and the final length of s is 2



```

Example 2: 
```python
Input:
"abcabd"
["ab","abcd"]
Output:
0
Explanation: 
abcabd -> abcd -> "" (length = 0)
```
