### Description

Given a list of Connections, which is the Connection class (the city name at both ends of the edge and a cost between them), find edges that can connect all the cities and spend the least amount.
Return the connection method if all cities can be connected, otherwise return empty list.

## (i)
Return the connections sorted by the cost, or sorted city1 name if their cost is same, or sorted city2 if their city1 name is also same

## Example
1
```python
Input:
["Acity","Bcity",1]
["Acity","Ccity",2]
["Bcity","Ccity",3]
Output:
["Acity","Bcity",1]
["Acity","Ccity",2]

```
2
```python
Input:
["Acity","Bcity",2]
["Bcity","Dcity",5]
["Acity","Dcity",4]
["Ccity","Ecity",1]
Output:
[]

Explanation:
No way

```
### SOLVE this:

```python
'''
Definition for a Connection
class Connection:

    def __init__(self, city1, city2, cost):
        self.city1, self.city2, self.cost = city1, city2, cost
'''
class Solution:
    # @param {Connection[]} connections given a list of connections
    # include two cities and cost
    # @return {Connection[]} a list of connections from results
    def lowestCost(self, connections):
        # Write your code here

```

### Official answer from lintcode
Use map to store automatic sorting, then use union to find the set, the roots of connected points should be the same.

            return -1
        else:
