### Official answer from lintcode
First scan all the characters, save the characters that have appeared, then scan again, and the first character that appears once is the answer.
```py
class Solution:
    # @param {string} s a string
    # @return {int} it's index
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        # Write your code here
        alp = {}
        for c in s:
            if c not in alp:
                alp[c] = 1
            else:
                alp[c] += 1

        index = 0
        for c in s:
            if alp[c] == 1:
                return index
            index += 1
        return -1
```
